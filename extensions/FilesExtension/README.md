# Files Extension for OpenRefine
OpenRefine provides a powerful feature for generating detailed file information from selected directories in your local system. This functionality allows users to create projects containing comprehensive file metadata.

Features included in this extension:
* Start an OpenRefine project by loading details of files from one or more folders on your local system.
* File details included are file name, extension, size in KB, creation date, last modification date, permissions, SHA-256 checksum, author and file path


It works with **OpenRefine 3.8.7 and later versions of OpenRefine**.

## Development

### Building from source

Run     
```
mvn package
```

This creates a zip file in the `target` folder, which can then be [installed in OpenRefine](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#installing-extensions).

### Developing it

To avoid having to unzip the extension in the corresponding directory every time you want to test it, you can also use another set up: simply create a symbolic link from your extensions folder in OpenRefine to the local copy of this repository. With this setup, you do not need to run `mvn package` when making changes to the extension, but you will still to compile it with `mvn compile` if you are making changes to Java files, and restart OpenRefine if you make changes to any files.

### Releasing it

- Make sure you are on the `master` branch and it is up to date (`git pull`)
- Open `pom.xml` and set the version to the desired version number, such as `<version>0.1.0</version>`
- Commit and push those changes to master
- Add a corresponding git tag, with `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Version 0.1.0"` (when working from GitHub Desktop, you can follow [this process](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-commits/managing-tags) and manually add the `v0.1.0` tag with the description `Version 0.1.0`)
- Push the tag to GitHub: `git push --tags` (in GitHub Desktop, just push again)
- Create a new release on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenRefine/FilesExtension/releases/new, providing a release title (such as "Files extension 0.1.0") and a description of the features in this release.
- Open `pom.xml` and set the version to the expected next version number, followed by `-SNAPSHOT`. For instance, if you just released 0.1.0, you could set `<version>0.1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>`
- Commit and push those changes.
